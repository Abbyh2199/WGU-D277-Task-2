            <h2>Florida's History</h2>
            <p>Florida was first inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years before it was discovered by European explorers. The first European to visit Florida was the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le√≥n in 1513. Florida was a Spanish colony for more than 200 years before it became a territory of the United States in 1821. Florida became the 27th state of the United States in 1845. During the American Civil War, Florida seceded from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America. Florida was readmitted to the Union in 1868.</p>
